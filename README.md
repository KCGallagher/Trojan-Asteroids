# Trojan Orbit Stability
### Part II Long Computing Project modelling the stability of Trojan Asteroids in Jupiter's Orbit

Trojan asteroids orbit the Sun in resonance with Jupiter at Lagrange points, and have their own stable orbits about these points. 
This can be treated as a restricted three-body problem, which is numerically evaluated in this report using a stiff Radau method to solve the system of coupled differential equations. 
I simulate the maximal deviation from the Lagrange points (in the rotating frame) without perturbations, to demonstrate the stability of these points.
Under small perturbations, I also demonstrate the predicted existence of stable tadpole and horseshoe orbits.

A list of the content of each file can be found in the 'program_structure.txt' file. 
The final report (and high resolution copies of the graphics included within) is given in the Figures file.
