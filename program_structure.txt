This file gives an overall outline of the function of each file.

Global constants, along with derived values from these, are given in a python module "constants", from
which relevant variables are imported in all other scripts.

Functions to evaluate the coupled differential equation systems are defined in the module "orbits",
while additional functions to evaluate the wander during the orbit are implemented in "wander". This is
defined as the transverse motion away from the equillibrium orbit, under small perturbations.

These modules are both imported into the scripts for plotting and analysis, and listed below:
